[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GameFoundry/bsf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GameFoundry/bsf) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/lafi3jj8bqowh25d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BearishSun/bsf)

bs::framework is a C++ library that aims to provide a unified foundation for the development of real-time graphical applications, whether games, engines or tools. It provides a wide range of high level systems, ranging from math and utility libraries, to a physically based renderer backed by Vulkan, DirectX or OpenGL, all the way to input, GUI, physics, audio, animation and scripting systems, with asset support for most popular resource formats.

**Highlights**
 * Built from the ground up in modern C++14 with a clean user-facing API and lightweight implementations without the crud often found in older, larger solutions. Offers a clean, highly modular architecture that can be easily understood, modified and built upon.
 * Built on a cross-platform, highly optimized, multi-threaded core that is robust and capable of running very demanding projects. 
 * Fully documented codebase with an extensive API reference, as well as a set of manuals introducing you to most major systems.

The project's ultimate goal is to build a feature-set comparable to commercial offerings, while offering unparallel quality when it comes to design and performance. If you are interested in adding some of those features make sure to check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf/blob/master/Documentation/GitHub/roadmap.md).
